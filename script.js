// the start moving function has a constant arrow. but it simply starts the "meme dance" when the function is called when the button on the screen is pressed.
    const startMoving = () => {
        intervalId = setInterval(() => { //intervalId = setInterval(); set interval is a function that has a pause when the function starts running. the Aarows above say to constantly call this function when the button is pressed for the meme to start moving. Below the memeImage is called from the styles.css sheet and implemented into the random interval to move across the screen at random stretches or intervals.
            memeImage.style.top = `${Math.random() * (window.innerHeight - 500)}px`; // calculating a random vertical position for the Memes movement. "-500px" to stay inside the screen!
            memeImage.style.left = `${Math.random() * (window.innerWidth - 500)}px`; // calculating the memes horizontal movement with the random stretch/interval. "-500px" to stay inside the screen!
		
		
            audio.play(); // the audio plays from the beginning of the function when the button is pressed.
        }, 1000);
    };
// this function stops the event! -- and stops the music with the event.
    const stopMoving = () => {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
        audio.pause();
        audio.currentTime = 0; // Reset audio to start
    };
