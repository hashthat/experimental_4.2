# experimental_4.2
# npm i -g live-server


in this project, I'm starting with a webserver which works locally through the chrome dev tools.

The local hosting environments I've had the chance to explore have been:
1) Multipass with Ubuntu
2) GitHub Pages
3) NodeJs, which I chose React as the framework given the package managers.
4) other websites with local hosting or editing capabilities with the idea of a REPL for interactive and learning purposes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

the command to start a server is still right here with the NodeJS package manager. The command with it's options are as follows;

npm i -g live-server

as long as this command is ran inside the folder for the sake of hosting the website that is being developed. A person can work with the chrome dev tools inside the browser while working with the command line and vim!
